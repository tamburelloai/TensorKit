# TensorKit: Tensor Support in Swift

A powerful and flexible tensor operations library in Swift. TensorKit is designed to be the backbone of Scorch but is maintained separately for use in a wide range of applications requiring array and tensor operations without the additional complexities of gradient based learning methods (i.e. neural networks).

## Features
- Tensor Operations: Perform efficient tensor operations with support for various data types including Float, Int, and Bool.
- Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) Support: Optional GPU acceleration for high-performance computing.
- Broadcasting: Seamlessly perform operations on tensors of different shapes.
- Shape Manipulation: Easily reshape, transpose, and manipulate tensor dimensions.
- Indexing: Advanced indexing capabilities similar to torch.Tensor.
- Extensibility: Designed to be extensible and integrable with other Swift projects.
